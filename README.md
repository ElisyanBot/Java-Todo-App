## Simple todo App
---

this is a todo app that takes a **.txt** file and convert is to a todo list.

For each new line a Todo-Item is created.

if the line starts with "[]" the item will be unchecked

else if the item is set with "[x]"  it will be checked.

if no bracket is added it will create an unchecked item.
